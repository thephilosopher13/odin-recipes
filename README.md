# odin-recipes
This is a small project that I am making as part of me learning basic HTML in Odin Project. The index is a homepage which links to 3 recipes which all have a title, description, image, ingredients and steps to cook. The ingredients are there for me to practice using unordered list and the steps to cooks are there to help me practice ordered list. The images also allow me to practice putting pictures in HTML.
