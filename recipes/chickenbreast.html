                  <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
                  <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
                  <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
                  <li>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                  <li>1/4 teaspoon dried basil</li>
               </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
               <ol>
                   <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                   <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic.</li>
                   <li>Sprinkle chicken with salt, black pepper, rosemary and basil.</li>
                   <li>Arrange chicken in a large baking dish.</li>
                   <li>Refrigerate chicken for at least 45 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Preheat your oven to 190 decrees C (Or 165 degrees F if you're a seppo).</li>
                   <li>Bake chicken in preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear (this takes around 45-60 minutes). The thickest part of the breast meat should have a temperature of around 75 degrees C (or 165 degrees F for seppos).</li>
                   <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
               </ol>
